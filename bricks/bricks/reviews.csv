All this makes Defense Colony a much sought after locality in Delhi, and hence the property prices are high in this area.

For the past few years Kandivali East has been among the top developing localities of the Western suburbs of Mumbai. The reason behind the increasing interest of buyers is this areas connectivity to the Western Express Highway; good infrastructure facilities such as shopping complexes, schools, colleges and affordability in comparison to the fully developed localities of Mumbai.

The target group for Kandivali East is buyers who can afford to shed about Rs 90 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Although, the type of construction in Kandivali East and Mira Road, Vasai or Virar is similar, yet demand for apartments in Kandivali East comes from the upper middle class segment. The connectivity to the Express Highway is better from Kandivali East as compared to Mira Road where affordable apartments are more in demand.
The prime reason for the increase in demand in Kandivali East is that the other fully developed areas in Mumbai like Bandra are too expensive and saturated for new buyers. Naushad further adds, People are shifting from the main town to less populated areas due to traffic snarls and space issues. Kandivali East has ready-to-move-in properties available with good infrastructure and space. These factors are driving people to shift to this region and also encouraging new buyers. Road connectivity is provided by means of Western Express Highway on the East, SV Road and Link Road on the west.

Dharuhera is an industrial area located on either side of NH8. Situated at a distance of 30 km from Gurgaon, it is a fast developing residential hub. It has been witnessing capital appreciation over the past few years ensuring continuous demand from investors. At the same time low prices, compared to Gurgaon and other neighboring localities have attracted end users too.
Several well-known developers are present here. Some of the developers in the locality include Avalon Group, Dwarkadhis Developers, Raheja Builders, Vipul Builders, Bestech Group and more. Lower prices have attracted investors to this part of the city. However, improving infrastructure is now fuelling an increased demand among end users as well.
Dharuhera is also well connected to the expanding NH-8. The national highway is currently being widened to 8-lanes from the existing 6-lanes. According to local realtors, the proposed Bullet Train linking Alwar-Delhi-Panipat-Meerut from Dharuhera will also add to the superb connectivity of the city.
In addition, Dharuhera also has several domestic and multi-national companies setting up base in the area. These companies have acquired land in the industrial areas of Khushkhera, Tapukara, Chopanki and Bawal that are located very close to Dharuhera. Job opportunities thus created, have further led to an increase in the housing demand. This enhanced commercial activity has made Dharuhera a preferred residential area for mid-income home buyers.
Pros:
The city offers rates much lower than that available in neighbouring Gurgaon.
High rate of capital appreciation is a good bet for investors.
Well connected to NH8

The industrial town near Gurgaon, Manesar, is a part of the Delhi NCR. The location, which was earlier a small village, has now turned up to be IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs fastest growing township. Proximity to Delhi has impacted the pace of growth of the area.

There are new projects by Ansal API, Raheja Developers, Crescent Park, DLF and SARE Homes in these sectors. While those by DLF and SARE Homes tap the upper segment, others have options for the middle-income segment.

Sector 56 in Gurgaon is one of the oldest sectors. It was established when the early service class professionals started migrating and settling in Gurgaon due to many offices and commercial hubs springing up here. Today, this sector is thriving with many residential colonies, local markets and eateries. The HUDA market of Sector 56 is a popular hub for local eateries and shopping.
The sector does not have any new residential projects coming up. However, it is still popular among temporary residents due to its lower rental values as compared to its neighboring areas. The rental value ranges between Rs 8000 to 40000 per month. Multistorey apartments and residential houses are the main types of housing available for rent.
The capital value of properties ranges between Rs 85 lakh and Rs 4 crore. Unlike the new multi-storey apartments across NCR, the housing units here are comparatively older in construction and do not have modern amenities such as gymnasium or swimming pool. Amenities such as tennis and squash courts and grocery stores are at a close proximity to the residential societies. They are priced economically compared to the new high rises. As a result, people living here enjoy the same facilities while paying lower rental value.
Another reason behind the popularity of the sector is the presence of a number of schools and hospitals within a 7 to 10 minutes drive from the locality. Tao Devi Lal Park, adjacent to the sector, gives children, senior citizens and families, a green space to relax in. Sector 56 also has a police station near the HUDA market.

Bellandur has recorded a significant growth in the prices of apartment complexes in the quarter ending Jul-Sep 2012. Sarjapur topped the list, recording 11 per cent growth, followed by Bellandur at about 9 per cent and Marathahalli which reported a price growth of about 8 per cent.
All these areas, including Bellandur, are near campuses of large IT MNCs. Although the global economic situation is tight, these companies have not really witnessed a dramatic downturn of fortunes. This coupled with the attractive loan market has contributed to the growth in these localities.
Bellandur is surrounded by Whitefield and Marathahalli on one side and Koramangala and Indira Nagar on the other. The demand for residential and commercial housing spills over from these areas, which are high in residentail values, to Bellandur. The area offers affordable housing options. Also, apartments in the budget range are available on the ORR, the nearby areas of Sarjapur Road and HSR layout.
Bellandur Lake is a major water body which is located in the area. Currently, most of Bengaluru's treated and untreated sewage is let into this lake, resulting in an odious stench that rises from the lake. The conversion of watershed area of the lake to residential and commercial layouts has hampered the ecology of the area.
The land around the lake is used as a dumping ground by builders and housing societies in the area.
